# Merge Sort

The array breaks down the data until it is in single unit. It then recombines them using cursors that only have touch each element once for each combination.
no matter the input array is sorted or not. merge sort always breaks data to the single unit. so its order always is O(nlogn). (so it can be considered the fastest sorting algorithm)
