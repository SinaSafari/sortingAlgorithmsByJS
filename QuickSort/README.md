# Quick Sort

Quick Sort starts picking a “pivot” point at the beginning. All numbers less than the pivot point go to the left, and all numbers greater than the pivot point go to the right. It then reapplies this algorithm to each side of the pivot. at the worst time, its order is O(n^2) and for best time it is O(nlogn).
